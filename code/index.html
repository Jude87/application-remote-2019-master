                  <p>Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. Simply put, it's the guideline for the mark-up language which determines how a web page. displays in a visitor's browser window. This increases the accessibility of websites by streamlining their structure according to a set of laid down rules and procedures.</p>

                  <h2>Advantages of web standards?</h2>

                         <li>Web pages will display in a wide variety of browsers and computers, including new technology like iPhones, Droids, iPads, PDA devices, mobile phones, which greatly increases the viewing audience.</li>
                         <li>W3C Standards promote the use of "Cascading Style Sheets" (CSS) or design code which is attached to the web page. rather than embedded in the page. The use of style sheets significantly reduces the page file size which means not only a faster page loading time but lower hosting costs for frequently visited sites due to using less bandwidth.</li>
